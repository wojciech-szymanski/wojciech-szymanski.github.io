            <p>My most recent work focused on building complex frontend applications using Javascript frameworks like AngularJS and React. I have also had a chance to explore a bit of functional world and coding interfaces using Elm.</p>

I have been heavily involved in all stages of digital delivery starting from requirements gathering workshops  through to successfull go-lives, and post launch maintenance.</p>
